# Spring boot quickstart

An application based on the [spring boot quickstart tutorial](https://spring.io/quickstart).

## Running the app

Use bootRun to run the app. The intellij configuration should already exist and be picked up by your editor.

Go on the [hello page](http://localhost:8080/hello) after bootRun.
